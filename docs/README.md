# Solar Energy Market

Community energy marketplace for a solar neighbourhood. IoT sensors
feed validated telemetry into PostgreSQL, the backend mints SUN
credits on an EVM chain, and the frontend lets households trade and
redeem them.

The project is built to run **entirely on a laptop** with a single
`make setup`. Every external dependency (broker, database, EVM node)
is a Docker container, and switching to AWS later is a configuration
change, not a code change.

## 1. Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + wagmi + MetaMask |
| Backend API | Python 3.12 + AWS Chalice |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 + TimescaleDB |
| Ingest | Python 3.12 + paho-mqtt |
| IoT simulation | Python 3.12 + grpcio + Mosquitto |
| Blockchain | Solidity 0.8.24 + Foundry (Anvil) |

## 2. Repository layout

| Directory | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `apps/frontend` | React dashboard, MetaMask integration |
| `apps/backend` | Chalice API, MQTT ingest, services, repositories, blockchain |
| `contracts` | Foundry project: SUNToken, EnergyMarketplace, RedemptionManager |
| `iot` | Simulator, gRPC gateway, MQTT publishers, telemetry schema |
| `database` | Consolidated schema, migrations, seeds |
| `infrastructure` | Docker Compose, Dockerfiles, Mosquitto config |
| `docs` | Architecture, MQTT topics, OpenAPI spec, contract docs, diagrams |
| `scripts` | Setup, seed, test, deploy automation |

## 3. Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+ with Compose v2
- Python 3.12
- Foundry (`forge`, `cast`, `anvil`) — install with
  `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup`
- `make`
- `jq` (used by `setup.sh` to inject contract addresses)
- On Gentoo, `forge` lives in `~/.foundry/bin`. Add it to your
  `PATH`:
  ```bash
  export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"
  ```

## 4. Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install Foundry dependencies (once)
cd contracts
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
forge build
cd ..

# 2. Install Python tooling for iot/ (once)
cd iot
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cd ..

# 3. Bootstrap everything
make setup
```

`make setup` runs `scripts/setup.sh`, which:

1. Verifies prerequisites.
2. Creates `infrastructure/docker/.env` from the example.
3. Compiles the Solidity contracts (`forge build`).
4. Generates the gRPC stubs (`make protos` in `iot/`).
5. Builds every Docker image.
6. Starts the stack and waits for all services to be healthy.
7. Deploys the contracts to Anvil.
8. Injects the deployed addresses into `.env`.
9. Restarts the backend so it picks them up.
10. Loads the SQL seeds.

At the end you should see:

```
✓ Setup complete

  API:        http://localhost:8000/api/v1
  Health:     http://localhost:8000/health
  MQTT:       localhost:1883
  Anvil RPC:  http://127.0.0.1:8545
  Postgres:   localhost:5432

  Logs:       make logs
  Stop:       make down
```

## 5. Services and ports

| Service | Container | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mosquitto` | `solar-mosquitto` | 1883 | MQTT broker |
| `timescaledb` | `solar-timescaledb` | 5432 | PostgreSQL + Timescale |
| `anvil` | `solar-anvil` | 8545 | Local EVM chain |
| `gateway` | `solar-gateway` | 50051 | gRPC server |
| `simulator` | `solar-simulator` | — | Telemetry generator |
| `subscriber` | `solar-subscriber` | — | MQTT → PostgreSQL |
| `api` | `solar-api` | 8000 | Chalice HTTP API |

## 6. Verifying the stack

```bash
# Container status
make ps

# Tail logs from every service
make logs

# Health checks
curl http://localhost:8000/health
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml \
  exec timescaledb pg_isready -U solar -d solar
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml \
  exec anvil cast block-number --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545

# Inspect live MQTT traffic
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml \
  exec mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -t 'solar/#' -v

# Inspect persisted telemetry
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml \
  exec timescaledb psql -U solar -d solar -c \
  "SELECT device_id, sensor_type, quality_status, COUNT(*)
   FROM telemetry_messages tm
   JOIN devices d ON d.id = tm.device_id
   GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;"
```

## 7. Daily commands

```bash
make up               # start the stack
make down             # stop the stack, keep volumes
make logs             # tail logs
make ps               # container status
make seed             # reload SQL seeds (idempotent)
make test             # run all test suites
make contracts-deploy # redeploy contracts and update .env
make clean            # stop the stack and remove volumes
```

## 8. Testing

The test suite is split by module:

```bash
# Everything (contracts + iot + backend)
make test

# Individual suites
make test-contracts   # Foundry
make test-iot         # iot/ pytest
make test-backend     # backend pytest (inside Docker)

# Integration tests (requires a live broker + DB)
./scripts/test.sh --integration
```

The backend tests run inside the `tests` container, so they share the
same Docker network and see `mosquitto`, `timescaledb` and `anvil`
exactly as production would.

## 9. Documentation

| Document | Content |
|---|---|
| `docs/architecture/overview.md` | System diagram, data flow, cross-cutting concerns |
| `docs/iot/topics.md` | MQTT topic layout and envelope schema |
| `docs/api/openapi.yaml` | HTTP API contract |

## 10. Environment variables

Every runtime setting is read from `infrastructure/docker/.env`. The
full list lives in `.env.example`. The most important ones:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `solar` | Database user |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `solar` | Database password |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `solar` | Database name |
| `INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `15` | Simulator cycle period |
| `PUBLISHER` | `mqtt` | Gateway publisher: `console`, `mqtt`, `aws_iot` |
| `WEB3_PROVIDER_URL` | `http://anvil:8545` | EVM RPC endpoint |
| `SUN_TOKEN_ADDRESS` | (injected) | SUN token contract |
| `ENERGY_MARKET_ADDRESS` | (injected) | Marketplace contract |
| `REDEMPTION_MANAGER_ADDRESS` | (injected) | Redemption contract |
| `BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY` | Anvil account #0 | Backend signer |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `change-me-in-production` | JWT signing key |

## 11. Troubleshooting

### `forge: command not found`

`foundryup` installs binaries under `~/.foundry/bin`, which is not on
`PATH` by default on some systems. Run:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"
```

and add the same line to your shell profile.

### `COPY failed: contracts/out: file does not exist`

`contracts/out` is the Foundry build directory. It does not exist
until you run `forge build`. Run it once and retry:

```bash
cd contracts && forge build && cd ..
make setup
```

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'grpc_tools'`

`grpc_tools` is a dev dependency of `iot/`. Install it:

```bash
cd iot
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If you are on a system with PEP 668 enforcement (Gentoo, Debian
testing), create a virtualenv first:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### `solar-gateway is unhealthy`

Check the logs first:

```bash
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml \
  logs solar-gateway --tail=100
```

Common causes:

- `ModuleNotFoundError: config.settings` — the Docker image was built
  without the `config` package. Verify that
  `iot/config/__init__.py` exists and that
  `[tool.setuptools.packages.find].include` in `iot/pyproject.toml`
  contains `config*`.
- `ModuleNotFoundError: sensor_pb2` — the `sed` patch of the generated
  `sensor_pb2_grpc.py` did not apply. Rebuild without cache:
  `docker compose ... build --no-cache gateway`.

### The subscriber logs `Unknown device`

The ingest worker refuses to auto-provision devices. Load the seeds:

```bash
make seed
```

or register the device through the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/devices \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"home_id":"...","device_code":"SM-CALI-001-001","device_type":"smart_meter"}'
```

## 12. Roadmap

The following extensions are planned but not implemented:

- Real-time notifications (WebSocket or Server-Sent Events).
- Multi-tenant authentication with per-home permissions.
- On-chain order book (matching currently happens off-chain).
- Price oracle for the redemption rate.
- Grafana dashboards fed by TimescaleDB.
- Deployment to AWS: IoT Core, RDS PostgreSQL, ECS for the backend,
  Chalice for the API.
